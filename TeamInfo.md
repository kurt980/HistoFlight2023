## Project Summary

Our project is a database-centric web-based application where users can learn historical flight information. The website takes data of current and historical flight price data for users so that they can check for historical trends and compare across different airlines. We also provide analysis and visualizations based on historical data and help users select their best flight, airline and best time to book a trip. Users can also interact with the website by updating comments on flights. 

This project will provide real world impact by providing a platform of comprehensive historical information for the users and detailed analysis that can help users make decisions on travel plans.
